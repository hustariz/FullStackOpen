As a grandpa dev, instead of learning 5 interchangeable languages of Algol-60 family , if you are a Jr. Dev. spend time learning:
1. Databases: esp db internals and query optimization
2. Unix/Linux esp the networking stack and file system stuff
3. Get into the details of at least one cloud platform
4. Learn bash: the number of problems that can be solved by a simple shell script (sed+awk+grep+pipes)
5. The art of writing clearly and concisely.

Programming is hard, that is why I will use all the possible means to make it easier:

*I will have my browser developer console open all the time
*I progress with small steps
*I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpointing problems
*If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working
*When I ask for help in the course Discord or Telegram channel or elsewhere I formulate my questions properly, see here how to ask for help


Full stack development is extremely hard, that is why I will use all the possible means to make it easier

*I will have my browser developer console open all the time
*I will use the network tab of the browser dev tools to ensure that frontend and backend are communicating as I expect
*I will constantly keep an eye on the state of the server to make sure that the data sent there by the frontend is saved there as I expect
*I will progress with small steps
*I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpoint problems
*If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working
